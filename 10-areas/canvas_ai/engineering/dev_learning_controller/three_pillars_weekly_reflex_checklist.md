# Three Pillars — Weekly Reflex Checklist

Use this checklist during coursework, side projects, or reviews. The goal is reflex formation, not completeness.

---

## Session-Level (pick at least one)

- [ ] Identified explicit system state and invariants
- [ ] Introduced noise or variability and observed behavior
- [ ] Identified a feedback loop and evaluated stability

---

## Pillar A — Computation as a System

- [ ] Named state variables explicitly
- [ ] Traced state transitions
- [ ] Identified at least one failure mode
- [ ] Checked invariants under edge cases

---

## Pillar B — Statistics as Inference

- [ ] Distinguished fact vs estimate
- [ ] Considered variance or distribution
- [ ] Repeated measurement or simulation
- [ ] Noted bias or overfitting risk

---

## Pillar C — Control & Adaptation

- [ ] Identified controlled variable
- [ ] Identified feedback signal
- [ ] Assessed stability (overshoot, oscillation, drift)
- [ ] Considered damping or adaptation

---

## Weekly Review (5–10 min)

- Which pillar felt most natural this week?
- Which pillar was hardest to apply?
- What reflex emerged without prompting?

---

This checklist is intentionally lightweight. Apply it selectively and consistently.
