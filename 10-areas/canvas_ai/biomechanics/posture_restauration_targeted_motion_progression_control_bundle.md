# Posture‑Restauration — Targeted Motion Progression & Control Bundle

This document bundles:
1. The **targeted motion progression table** (state → objective → motions → cues → readiness)
2. A **1‑week micro‑cycle** mapped to the progression
3. A **live decision tree** for in‑session regression and control

## 1. Targeted Motion Progression

| Phase | Primary Objective | Targeted Motions (Priority Order) | Why This Phase Exists | Key Cues / Constraints | Readiness to Progress |
|------|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|----------------------|
| **0. Inhibition / Decompression** | Reduce dominant tonic holding (QL, hip flexors) | • Long exhale + posterior rib drop  
• Gentle pelvic posterior tilt  
• Side‑lying QL lengthening | New motor patterns cannot integrate while tonic stabilizers dominate. This phase creates system permissiveness. | • Exhale > inhale  
• Pelvis heavy  
• No stretch intensity | QL tone reduces during gait; hip no longer snaps back |
| **1. Foot Intrinsics + Ankle Stack** | Restore local stability | • Tripod loading  
• Slow plantar flexion  
• Dorsiflexion with knee tracking  
• Light eversion under load | Foot must become reliable so force stops leaking upward. Cramping = recruitment without endurance. | • Pressure under 1st MT  
• Heel heavy  
• No clawing | Arch cramping decreases; plantar flexion emerges automatically |
| **2. Tibial Control → Knee Acceptance** | Allow knee to receive force | • Dorsiflexion + knee glide  
• Step‑downs (eccentric)  
• Split‑stance knee travel | Knee ceases acting as a stabilizer once distal control is present. | • Knee tracks 2nd toe  
• Quiet foot | Knee remains quiet on stairs/slopes |
| **3. Hip Centering (Sagittal + Transverse)** | Re‑establish hip as prime mover | • Hip flexion (neutral pelvis)  
• Hip extension without lumbar assist  
• Internal rotation under load | Hip must accept flexion before expressing extension. | • Pelvis level  
• Femur moves, spine stays | Hip no longer drifts back; IR accessible |
| **4. Lateral Chain Re‑sequencing** | Integrate QL as stabilizer | • Curtsey step‑downs  
• Short‑ROM lateral lunges  
• Single‑leg stance + reach | QL transitions from driver to timing stabilizer. | • Hip stays low  
• No side‑bend | QL fatigues without spasm |
| **5. Elastic Gait + Reactive Control** | Restore automaticity | • Short accelerations  
• Uphill walking  
• Light bounds/skips | Converts strength + control into economy. | • No internal cueing | Pattern holds under speed/stress |
| **6. Consolidation (Default Mode)** | Make pattern baseline | • Varied terrain  
• Fatigue exposure  
• Uncued daily movement | Pattern persistence under distraction. | • Minimal monitoring | Old patterns fail to re‑emerge |

## 2. One‑Week Micro‑Cycle (Repeatable)

### Day 1 — Phase 0 → 1 (Permission + Base)
- Long exhale decompression (5–7 min)
- Tripod loading + slow plantar flexion
- Gentle eversion holds

**Stop if:** arch cramping escalates → return to exhale work

---

### Day 2 — Phase 1 → 2 (Load Acceptance)
- Dorsiflexion with knee travel
- Low step‑downs (slow eccentric)

**Stop if:** ankle sway appears → regress to Phase 1

---

### Day 3 — Phase 3 (Hip Re‑centering)
- Supine or supported hip flexion
- Controlled hip extension
- Loaded IR drills

**Stop if:** lumbar extension substitutes → return to Phase 0 + 3 light

---

### Day 4 — Phase 0 + 4 (Lateral Timing)
- QL decompression
- Curtsey step‑downs (very shallow)
- Single‑leg stance with reach

**Stop if:** pelvis hikes → reduce ROM

---

### Day 5 — Phase 5 (Elastic Exposure)
- Uphill walking
- Short accelerations (sub‑max)

**Stop if:** conscious cueing returns → regress to Phase 3

---

### Day 6 — Phase 6 (Consolidation)
- Normal day movement
- No drills unless breakdown occurs

---

### Day 7 — Review / Reset
- Observe default gait
- Note where tone accumulates
- Use Phase 0 only

---

## 3. Live Decision Tree (In‑Session Control)

- **Arch cramps** → Phase 1 overdose → regress to Phase 0 + lighter foot load
- **Ankle sways laterally** → Phase 4 too early → return to Phase 2
- **Knee discomfort** → tibial control incomplete → Phase 2 only
- **Hip snaps back** → Phase 3 incomplete → remove lateral work
- **QL tightens/spasms** → Phase 0 missing → decompression first
- **Need constant cueing** → Phase 5 attempted too early

---

## Operating Principle

Only progress when the *next joint up* is quiet.
Stability must emerge **without attention** before load increases.
